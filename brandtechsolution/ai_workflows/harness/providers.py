"""Provider adapters: credentials, activation, and listing models.

One adapter per provider, each knowing three things -- where its credential
comes from, how to list its models, and how to read that listing. Adding a
sixth provider is a class here and nothing else.

Verified against the live endpoints on 2026-09-21. The finding that shapes
this module: **only OpenRouter publishes pricing through its API.** It is also
unauthenticated, and it lists the other four providers' models under
`anthropic/`, `openai/`, `google/` and `deepseek/` slugs -- which makes it the
metadata source for everyone, with the ceiling recorded on every row it feeds
(see `CatalogueEntry.price_source`).
