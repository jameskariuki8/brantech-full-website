"""One tool registry, and the suite each agent is issued.

Tools were chat-only. `search_blog_posts`, `search_projects` and a per-user
info tool were bound to the assistant and nothing else -- so the research agent
could not search the knowledge base its own pipeline populates, and the fact
verifier checked claims against the model's own weights with no tools at all.

Two kinds of tool, because the existing three are already both kinds:

- **static** -- the same object for every caller (`search_blog_posts`).
- **bound** -- built per request from runtime context, because the tool closes
  over something only the caller knows. `get_user_info` has to be bound to a
  user id; a shared instance would answer for whoever called it last, which is
  a data leak rather than a design preference.

Suites are declared here rather than on each agent so that "who can reach
what" is answerable by reading one table.

# giving them `search_knowledge` and `fetch_url` changes what they can *do* --
# the fact verifier would start checking claims against real sources rather
# than against the model's own weights -- and that belonged behind its own
# review rather than smuggled in with a refactor. Step 9 is that review.
#
# Who gets what, and why not everyone:
#
#   fact_verifier  both. It is the agent whose entire job is checking claims
#                  against something outside itself, and until now the
#                  something was the model's own weights.
