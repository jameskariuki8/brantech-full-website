#                            the containers read.
#
# pydantic-settings reads real environment variables at higher priority than
# any env_file, so inside Docker the root file wins and the path above is
# irrelevant. Outside Docker the root file is never read at all.
#
# That asymmetry is invisible and it cost a full day: a key was rotated in the
# root file, the local process kept reading a months-old key from the other
# one, and every symptom pointed at the API rather than at the file. Nothing
# raised, because nothing was wrong -- both files were valid, and the wrong one
# was being read perfectly.
#
# So: report it. Not merge the files, which would hand a local `manage.py` the
# container's database credentials, and not refuse to start, because the two
# files differing is the *normal* state for everything else in them.

# environment-specific: the same key works in both, so the two disagreeing
