## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Bots aimed at the login page could slow sign-in for everyone and guess passwords without limit**: every attempt ran the deliberately slow password hash, up to three times for a wrong password, on the site's three web workers, and nothing counted failures. Now (`brand/login_throttle.py`):
  - A wrong password costs one hash, not two or three.
  - After 5 failures in 15 minutes from one address, or against one account, or 100 failures site-wide, each attempt must pass the Cloudflare Turnstile challenge. Attempts without it are refused before the password is checked, so a flood no longer queues real sign-ins.
  - After 30 failures in 15 minutes an address is refused outright (HTTP 429). No account is ever locked: the owner can always get in by solving the challenge, so nobody can lock a colleague out by guessing.
  - `/admin/login/` signs in through the same view, so Django admin's form is not a way around the limits.
  - The `next` parameter on login is checked, so a link to the login page can no longer redirect to another site after sign-in.
- **Other public endpoints a bot could hammer had no limits**:
  - **Password reset** (`/accounts/password_reset/`) sent an email for every request, so a script could fill any inbox through our Mailgun quota. It now needs the Turnstile challenge, refuses a network after 5 requests an hour, and sends at most 3 reset emails an hour to one address. The page still says the email is on its way when that limit is hit, so it never reveals which addresses have accounts. The "Forgot password?" links on the login pages now open it.
  - **Website chat** (`/api/ai/chat/`) made a paid model call for every message and held a web worker while it waited. It is now limited to 20 messages per 10 minutes per network (`CHAT_RATE_LIMIT_COUNT`, `CHAT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`), and an error no longer sends the exception text to the visitor.
  - **Booking lookup** (`/appointments/get/`) returns a client's booking when id, email and phone match; it allows 10 lookups per 10 minutes per network and no longer echoes exception text. The **availability check** allows 60 per 10 minutes.
  - **Sign-up** allows 5 per hour per network, on top of the Turnstile challenge.
  - **Change password** in the panel allows 5 attempts per 15 minutes per account, so a stolen session cannot be used to guess the current password.
- **People who used the "Sign up" link could never get into the panel**: both login pages linked to the public `/signup/` form, which creates ordinary non-staff accounts. The panel turned them away without a message, Staff & Roles could not find them, and inviting the same email was refused because the address was taken. Now:
  - The login pages say staff accounts are created by invitation instead of linking to sign-up.
  - Staff & Roles search finds sign-up accounts, marked "Signed up, not staff", and they have their own filter.
  - Sign-up is closed: `/signup/` now creates a deactivated account, and signing in to one says it is not active yet.
  - Login confirms a deactivated account's password only for sign-up accounts; a deactivated staff account gets the generic "invalid email/username or password" message, so a former employee's old password cannot be checked through the login page.
  - Anyone with `manage_staff` sees normal (non-staff) accounts in Staff & Roles, marked "Not staff yet".
  - Opening one sends a staff invitation to its address. Accepting it takes the account over with a new password, staff status and the invited roles. Sign-up never verifies the address, so the account is never made staff without proof the person holds that inbox, and the people API cannot edit sign-up accounts.
- **Staff could read shared mail and inquiries, and everyone was emailed every lead**: team invitations hand out the Support role, which carried `view_inbox` and `handle_inquiries`, so every staff member could read info@ and the other shared mailboxes. Every website inquiry, booking and email to info@ also went to the whole team's personal inboxes, including third-party mail such as account verification links. Now:
  - Each person sees only their own mailbox.
  - Shared mailboxes, mail to unclaimed addresses, website inquiries and oversight of other mailboxes are for superusers only, by a fixed rule in `messaging/mailbox.py` (`is_admin`) and `staff.permissions.IsSuperuser`.
  - Inquiry, booking and shared-mail notifications go to superusers only.
  - The `view_inbox`, `handle_inquiries` and `view_all_mail` capabilities are removed, and migration `staff.0020` deletes their grants, so no role can give this access again. The Support role keeps `manage_appointments`.
- **Staff notifications exposed everyone's personal address**: every capability-based notification (inquiries, bookings, shared mail, task reviews, editorial reviews, mail-limit notices, system alerts) was one message with every recipient on the To line. They are now sent as one message per person (`brandtechsolution.mail.send_mail_each`).
- **Pending migration warning on `brand`**: the flagship badge, solution label and solution description defaults on `SiteContent` were changed in `models.py` without a migration, so `manage.py migrate` reported unmigrated model changes. Migration `brand.0020` records them. Defaults only; no table changes.
- **Staff panel unreadable in light theme**: panel sections were written for dark mode with fixed classes (white text, white-tinted fills and borders, near-black inputs), so in light theme names, tabs and filters vanished and inputs stayed black. A new `panel-light.css`, loaded by `admin_base.html`, maps those classes onto the theme colours in light mode only (white text on solid buttons stays white). The panel's theme colours (`brand-blue`, `dark-card`, `surface` and others) are now wrapped in `color-mix`, so opacity modifiers such as `bg-brand-blue/10` draw instead of producing no colour. Five coloured messages that were `<p>` elements, which the shared stylesheet forces to grey, are now `div`s so warnings and errors show in colour.
- **Partnership track icon and colour ignored on the public page**: `/partnerships/` picked each card's icon by searching the track name for words such as "Academic" or "Tech". Cards now use the icon and accent colour set for the track in Partnerships & People, and the tagline shows in that colour.
- **Booking calendar unreadable in light theme**: the "Book a Strategy Session" modal on the contact page used `bg-surface/95` and `bg-surface/50`. Tailwind cannot add transparency to a colour defined as a CSS variable, so no background was drawn and dark text sat on the dark overlay. The card is now solid white (near-black in dark theme) and its inner panels use slate-50 / white-5%. The contact info cards and social tiles on the same page had the same see-through `bg-surface/50` and now use the solid `bg-surface` card colour.
- **"Partnerships & People" opened Access denied for administrators**: the link is shown to anyone holding Manage staff, but it opens Django admin, which checks per-model permissions that panel roles never carry, so only superusers got in. The Career, Partnership type and Partner organisation admin pages now allow staff who hold Manage staff, the same rule as Website Content.
- **Careers missing from stored header menus**: the header menu is saved in `SiteContent.header_links`, so sites created before the careers page never received its default link. Migration `brand.0019` adds "Careers & Jobs" to the About / Company submenu of each stored menu, and leaves a menu alone if it already links to `/careers/` or has no such submenu.

### Added
- **Close and reopen job openings and partnership tracks, hide and show partners**: in Partnerships & People, each partnership track has a one-click Close / Reopen button (closed tracks move to the archived list on `/partnerships/`) and each partner has Hide / Show, which takes it off or puts it back on the partners strip without deleting it. All three tabs share one POST-only view (`admin_partnership_status`), with the same permission as editing. Each job opening also has a Close / Reopen button and an Open/Closed status (also on the edit form and in Django admin). Closed roles leave `/careers/`, which shows a "No open roles right now" message when nothing is open. Migration `brand.0021` adds `Career.status` and `Career.closed_at`; existing roles stay open.
- **Applications-closed auto-reply**: an email that applies to a closed role gets an automatic reply saying applications have closed, sent from the role's address and filed in the same mailbox conversation (`messaging/autoreply.py`). The Apply link's subject now carries a `JOB-<id>` reference so the role is identified even when roles share an inbox; older subjects ("Application for <title>") are still matched. Each sender is told once per role, and machine senders (no-reply, mailer-daemon, `Auto-Submitted`, bulk/list mail, our own domain) are never answered. A notice is only sent when every `X-Mailgun-Spf` verdict in Mailgun's message-headers list is a pass and the envelope sender's domain matches the From domain, so a forged From address (or a forged verdict header) cannot aim it at someone who never wrote. Automatic replies are also capped at 50 an hour overall.
- **Attachments in staff mail** (`docs/plans/2026-10-18-mail-attachments-plan.md`): the panel mail client had no attachments anywhere. Compose and reply could not attach files, and files sent to us were thrown away, leaving only their names.
  - Compose and reply have an Attach button. Picked files show with their size and can be removed before sending. Limits are 10 files and 20 MB in total, and executable types (`.exe`, `.js`, `.bat` and others) are refused before sending because providers reject them. The API accepts `multipart/form-data` with `attachments` fields; JSON without files still works.
  - Files received through the Mailgun inbound webhook are now stored (new `MailAttachment` model, migration `messaging.0019`). An email to several mailboxes stores each file once. In the reader, attachments are download links. Mail received before this change still lists names only, marked "not kept".
  - Files are kept under `MAIL_ATTACHMENTS_ROOT` (default `brandtechsolution/private/mail_attachments`, Docker volume `./data/private`), never under the public `/media/`. `GET /api/messaging/mail/attachments/<id>/` serves them only to people who can read the conversation (others get 404), always as a download with `nosniff` and a sandbox CSP, so a received HTML or SVG file cannot run in the panel.
- **Partnerships & People page in the staff panel** (`/admin-panel/partnerships/`, `docs/specs/2026-10-12-partnerships-people-panel-spec.md`): the sidebar link used to open Django admin in a new tab. It now opens a panel page with tabs for partnership tracks, partner organisations and job openings, each with add, edit and delete. Forms validate Font Awesome icons, accent colours, http(s)-only links, logo size (2 MB) and job file type (PDF, DOC, DOCX up to 10 MB). Delete is POST-only with an on-page confirmation. Same access rule as Website Content; the page follows the panel's light and dark themes and works at phone width. The Website Content banner links here too; the Django admin pages stay as a fallback.
- **Themed access-denied page** (`403.html`): replaces Django's bare "403 Forbidden" for every permission failure, says whose account is signed in and who can grant access, and links back to the panel.
- **Area of work ("scope") in staff onboarding and profile** (`docs/specs/2026-10-12-staff-scope-onboarding-spec.md`):
  - New `StaffProfile.scopes` (migration `staff.0019`): the parts of the business a person works in, such as Marketing, Sales & Partnerships, Operations, or anything they type themselves.
  - Onboarding asks for at least one scope, offers non-engineering roles (Marketing Lead, Operations Manager and others), and collapses the languages, frameworks and GitHub fields into an optional "Technical skills" section that opens for Engineering and Product & Design.
  - The dashboard "My profile" form can now edit scope and bio as well as the existing details, using the same suggestions as onboarding (served as `options` by `GET /api/staff/me/`).
  - Staff & Roles shows each person's scopes and searches by them; `GET /api/staff/people/` includes read-only `scopes`.

### Changed
- **Careers address must be on our own domain**: new job openings default to `careers@<MAILBOX_DOMAIN>` instead of `careers@teklora.com`, the careers page footer uses the same address, and saving a role whose application address is on any other domain is refused (`Career.clean`, so the panel and Django admin both enforce it). Only mail that reaches the Mailgun inbound webhook can be auto-answered once a role closes.
- **Editorial pipeline consolidated into one app** (`docs/plans/2026-10-16-editorial-consolidation-plan.md`): the pipeline had been scaffolded as one Django app per "Module N" agent. Seven of those apps existed only to serve `editorial`, and most imported `editorial.models` back. `trends`, `research`, `seo`, `media_generation`, `analytics`, `approval` and `publishing` are now domains inside `editorial/`:
  - Models live in `editorial/models/<domain>.py`, views in `editorial/views/`, agents in `editorial/services/` (with `trends/` and `research/` sub-packages), the orchestrator, newsroom and Celery tasks in `editorial/pipeline/`, and tests in `editorial/tests/`.
  - `from editorial.models import X` and `from editorial.tasks import ...` still work, and Celery task names are unchanged.
  - Migrations: editorial's history is squashed into `0001_squashed_consolidation`, which existing databases treat as already applied. `0002` relabels the 11 moved models' content types to `editorial`, so permissions, admin history and memory documents stay attached. `0003` renames their tables from `trends_*`, `research_*` etc. to `editorial_*`. Row counts were verified unchanged on a copy of the dev database. Deploying needs only `manage.py migrate`.
  - `knowledge_base` stays its own app: it is the vector store used by `ai_workflows` beyond the newsroom.
- **Contact UI & Interactive Experience Refinement**:
  - Unified the visual language of [`contacts.html`](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/contacts.html) with modern dark/light glassmorphic tokens, ambient glow gradients, and cohesive `#007AFF` / `#00FF94` brand palettes.
  - Re-architected interactive Strategy Calendar modal with dynamic date initialization (`new Date()`), real-time day/slot selections, and touch-optimized controls.
  - Aligned global footer container in [`footer.html`](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/footer.html) with standard `max-w-7xl` layout and enhanced mobile responsiveness for columns, legal links, and copyright notices.
  - Sized and refined the Partnership Application modal card (`#applyModalCard`) in [`partnerships.html`](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/partnerships.html) with compact bounds (`max-w-lg`, `max-h-[85vh]`), dynamic track badge pill, reduced form paddings, and smooth inner scroll container to eliminate oversized vertical height on mobile and desktop viewports.
  - Fixed overlay ordering for strategic consultation modals: raised `calendarModal` and `bookingModal` z-index to `2000` to sit above the glassmorphic header, and added semi‑transparent `bg-surface/95` (light) / `dark:bg-[#090D16]/95` (dark) to the booking card for clearer visibility in light mode.
- **Staff & Roles panel redesigned around access levels** (`docs/specs/2026-10-12-staff-roster-access-levels-spec.md`):
  - People roster shows each person's derived level (Owner, Administrator, Member, No access), role chips, last sign-in, and setup/deactivated status, with search and filter chips that carry counts.
  - Person editor shows what each role grants, a live preview of the resulting access, and explains why controls are locked (editing yourself or an owner) instead of failing on save.
  - Roles tab lists the capabilities each role grants and links to the people who hold it.
  - Invitations waiting are separated from the roster; the editor becomes a bottom sheet on phones.
  - `GET /api/staff/people/` now includes read-only `last_login`.

### Fixed
- **Contact Page Layout & Modal Hierarchy**:
  - Resolved malformed DOM hierarchy in [`contacts.html`](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/contacts.html) where modal bodies, turnstiles, and scripts were fragmented outside the document body.
  - Eliminated duplicate Strategy Calendar CTA buttons and repaired modal backdrop, dismissal triggers, and keyboard `Escape` bindings.
- **Onboarding now reaches every staff member**: the gate in `staff/middleware.py` skipped any staff account with no `StaffProfile` row, which covered everyone who existed before onboarding shipped and anyone created through `createsuperuser` or `/admin/`. A missing profile now counts as not onboarded, the onboarding page creates it on first visit, and superusers without `is_staff` (admitted to the panel by `brand.views.is_admin`) are gated and can complete it too.

### Added
- **Dedicated Partnerships & CSR Page (`/partnerships/`)**:
  - Engineered standalone, glassmorphic Partnerships and Corporate Social Responsibility hub (`brand/templates/brand/partnerships.html`) showcasing active partnership tracks, collaborative workflow, CSR pillars, partner logos, and an interactive application modal.
  - Replaced all emojis, font icon glyphs, and bullet symbols with exact, crisp inline vector `<svg>` elements across all badges, lifecycle steps, track cards, benefit/requirement checklists, and CSR feature cards.
  - Implemented dynamic database models `PartnershipType` and `PartnerOrganisation` supporting real-time admin management for open/closed tracks, benefits, criteria, and partner organizations.
  - Dedicated CSR mandate to organizations touching the lives of children (orphanages, rescue shelters, digital literacy, child safety) and ministries spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ (churches, missionary societies, congregation tools).
  - Clarified EduShare status across the platform: explicitly established that EduShare is not currently zero-rated, launching a public call and partnership track for telecommunications carriers (Safaricom, Airtel, MTN) and educational donors to sponsor student data and zero-rate syllabus access across Kenya's 47 counties and the African continent.
  - Positioned CSR under the Partnerships ecosystem and wired global header dropdown and footer quick links directly to `/partnerships/`.
  - Added full Django Admin management interfaces with list filtering, ordering, and quick-access management buttons from the Teklora Admin panel (`admin_base.html` and `admin_site_content.html`).
- **Company & Corporate Navigation Restructuring**:
  - Reorganized the global navigation and footer from "About" to "Company", housing all company dimensions: *About Us & Story*, *Mission & Values*, *Careers & Jobs* (`/careers/`), *CSR & Social Impact* (`/about/#csr`), and *Partnerships*.
  - Updated [about.html](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/about.html) with a direct link and action card for open roles linking directly to the full [Careers Page](brandtechsolution/brand/templates/brand/careers.html).
- **Mobile Navigation Modal Popup & Dropdown Redesign**:
  - Transformed mobile dropdown into a sleek, floating glassmorphism popup modal with full-screen dimming blur backdrop.
  - Sized compactly (`max-width: 380px`, reduced paddings, concise fonts) so the popup fits comfortably on phone screens without feeling oversized.
  - Added dedicated popup header featuring brand logo, title, and intuitive close button (`<i class="fas fa-times"></i>`).
  - Implemented collapsible accordion cards for dropdown items with smooth rotate transitions and sublink icons.
  - Added quick-access theme switch pill (`Dark / Light Mode`) and high-contrast consultation CTA button.
  - Added backdrop click, `Escape` key dismiss, and automatic background scroll locking for phone UX.
- **Careers Page & Admin Management Specification**:
  - Authored comprehensive specification ([`2026-10-11-careers-page-admin-management-spec.md`](docs/specs/2026-10-11-careers-page-admin-management-spec.md)) detailing the `JobOpening` model architecture, dynamic querying, and `/admin-panel/?section=careers` management hub.
  - Added Milestone 4 to [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
- **Staff GitHub Repository Scanning & Permission Discovery**:
  - Automatically scan repositories owned by staff members configured via `StaffProfile.github_username`.
  - Filter repositories to only include those where the platform's authenticated GitHub account has access (push/write, admin, maintain, or private pull access).
  - Categorize staff repositories with `role="staff"` and attach staff member attribution metadata (`username`, `staff_name`, `primary_role`).
  - Added dedicated `Staff` filter tab, metric badge counters, and owner chips in GitHub Manager admin dashboard (`/admin-panel/?section=githubSync`).
  - Synced staff projects automatically save with `github_role="staff"`.
- **Staff Onboarding & Capabilities Engine**:
  - Interactive onboarding wizard (`/staff/onboarding/`) prompting staff for WhatsApp number, primary engineering role, programming languages, and frameworks.
  - Comprehensive technology catalog covering AI/Computer Vision (OpenCV, PyTorch, Whisper, Gemini, RAG), Web & Backend (Django, FastAPI, Flask, DRF, Next.js, HTMX), Automation & Bots (Playwright, Browser-Use, WhatsApp/Telegram APIs, n8n), and Mobile/Desktop (Flutter, Android SDK, PySide6/Qt, Tauri).
  - Automatic Kenyan & international phone normalization to E.164 (`+254...`) with `wa.me` integration in the Admin panel.
  - Extended `StaffProfile` with `coding_languages`, `frameworks`, `primary_role`, `github_username`, `bio`, and `is_onboarded`.
  - Updated `MeSerializer` and Admin User Profile modal with real-time capability viewing and editing.
  - Onboarding gatekeeper middleware ensuring invited staff complete setup before navigating the panel.
- **Repository Engineering & Agent Infrastructure**:
  - `AGENTS.md` canonical instructions for AI pair-programming and autonomous workflows.
  - Universal symlinks for AI agents (`.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.agentrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` developer workflow guidelines.
